# YNOGK

This the source code for the YNOGK (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0067-0049/207/1/6) or (https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1250) program. YNOGK was originally written by Fortran. Now we rewrite it by c language and use gcc and makefile to compile it. One can learn how to use it by run the test examples in the examples file folder. One can go into corresponding file directory and run the make command.

The code was developed under the Fedora of Linux operating system. So we recommend compiling it in the Linux operating system.
